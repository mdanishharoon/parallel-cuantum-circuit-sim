# Quantum Circuit Simulator with Graph Partitioning and Parallel Tensor Contraction

A distributed quantum circuit simulation framework that leverages **graph partitioning (METIS)**, **multi-node parallelism (MPI)**, and **intra-node acceleration (OpenCL/OpenMP)** to scale tensor network contractions for large quantum circuits.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project simulates quantum circuits by modeling them as **tensor networks** and contracting them using parallel resources across multiple compute nodes.

- **Graph-based approach**: Exploits the graph structure of quantum circuits.
- **Distributed Execution**: Partitions the circuit into subgraphs across MPI ranks.
- **Accelerated Contraction**: Uses OpenCL or OpenMP for local tensor contraction steps.
- **Scalable & Modular**: Designed to run on lab clusters or cloud-based VM environments.
